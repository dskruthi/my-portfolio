      <h1 style="text-align:center;">The pieces that make up my WORLD!</h1>
      
      <p><b>Who am I?</b><br>Namaste! To know me means to know that I love my indian heritage. I take pride in my dual identity as indian-american and being raised in a household that cherishes both cultures. There isn't a day that goes by without indian food and indian music!
      </br></p>
      <br></br>
      <p><b>Passions?</b><br>Apart from academics, I find joy in dancing and serving my community. I've been an Indian Classical Dancer for over ten years trained in the art form of Kuchipudi. From middle school to now, I have found various origanizations that resonated with me and spent time tutoring, volunteering, and making an effort towards change. As an girl scout of 8+ years, I learned to be a go-getter and so I look most forward to making impact in the STEM community for women.
      </br></p>
      <br></br>
      <p><b>Why CS?</b><br>Computer Science is an evergrowing field of study that facilitates global change on a daily basis. I strongly believe that it empowers me in my journey to making an impact in my community while giving me the joy of tackling seemingly impossible code.
